# AI / ML Engineer Learning Path 🚀

This repository documents my **structured learning journey** toward becoming an **AI / ML Engineer (Fresher Level)**.

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Track my learning progress
- Maintain a clear and focused roadmap
- Build strong fundamentals step by step
- Avoid random or shallow learning

This repository currently focuses on **learning and preparation**.  
Projects will be added **after building strong foundations**.
